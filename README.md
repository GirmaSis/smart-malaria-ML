### Notebooks included
- `ANN_Maleria.ipynb` â€” Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implementation
- `KNN_Maleria.ipynb` â€” K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) implementation
- `Malaria_SVM.ipynb` â€” Support Vector Machine (SVM) implementation
- `NaÃ¯ve_Bayes_Malaria.ipynb` â€” NaÃ¯ve Bayes implementation

Each notebook applies machine learning to classify malaria cases as **Parasitized** or **Normal** based on 15 IoT-sensed symptoms from a Nigerian dataset ([ðŸ”— source](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2019.104997)).
